# PBI-ASSIGNMENTS
1-DATA TRANSFORMATION
The dataset was cleaned by correcting data types, handling missing values, and removing duplicates. Formatting inconsistencies, like dates and text, were standardized for consistency and accuracy.

2-DAX OPERATIONS
This project uses DAX operations in Power BI for dynamic reporting, including custom tables, calculated measures, and year-to-date analysis. It enables detailed insights through interactive filters and safe calculations with DIVIDE.

3-DATA VISUALIZATION
In Power BI, begin by cleaning and preparing your data in Power Query to ensure consistency and accuracy. Set up relationships between tables for smooth filtering and interaction across visuals. Choose key visuals carefully—such as bar charts for sales by region or maps for geographic insights—and enhance interactivity with slicers, cross-filtering.
